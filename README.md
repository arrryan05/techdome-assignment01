# SpaceX Launch Program

This project is a modern, functional React application that utilizes a component-based structure. It fetches data from the SpaceX Launches API and displays the information in a user-friendly format. The application also uses URL query parameters to filter the displayed data based on Launch Year, Launch Success, and Land Success.

## Technologies Used

- React.js

- Sass


## Approach

The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The component-based structure of React allows for efficient code reuse and better organization of code.

Data is fetched from the SpaceX Launches API, which provides comprehensive information about SpaceX's launches. This data is then displayed in a user-friendly format.

The application also provides filtering functionality. Users can filter the displayed data based on various parameters such as Launch Year, Launch Success, and Land Success. This is achieved using URL query parameters.
